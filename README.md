Neurograph, also unformally named a "brainscan", is a data format containing information used to reconstruct brain connectome. \
This repository contains all public neurographs that were scanned or converted by us.

### Info
C. Elegans is a free-living, transparent nematode worm.
It is a powerful model organism for studying a wide range of biological processes,
  including development, behavior, and aging.
It's one of the first creatures to have it's brain fully mapped and simulated.
Similarly, this is the first creature to have it's scan to be mapped with neurograph
  method and simulated in Vivarium.
### Stats
`397` neurites
`3689` synapses
### Provided files
- `worm.ng` - Flat Neurograph version 3: C. Elegans connectome.
