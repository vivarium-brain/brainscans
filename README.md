Neurograph, also unformally named a "brainscan", is a data format containing information used to reconstruct brain connectome. \
This repository contains all public neurographs that were scanned or converted by us.

# Stored scans

## Caenorhabditis Elegans (caenorhabditis_elegans)
![neurograph type flat](https://img.shields.io/badge/neurograph%20type-flat-0077ff?style=for-the-badge) \
[ awaiting Peek render... ]
### Info
C. Elegans is a free-living, transparent nematode worm.
It is a powerful model organism for studying a wide range of biological processes,
  including development, behavior, and aging.
It's one of the first creatures to have it's brain fully mapped and simulated.
Similarly, this is the first creature to have it's scan to be mapped with neurograph
  method and simulated in Vivarium.

[ awaiting Peek render... ]
### Info
Drosophila melanogaster, or the fruit fly, is a small, common insect.
It's a powerful model organism for studying a wide range of biological processes,
  including development, behavior, and aging, due to its relatively simple genome,
  short lifespan, and ease of breeding in a laboratory setting.
